# Introduction to System Modeling using Differential Equations

## Intro

Mathematical Models are fundamental to the design of feedback control systems.
Control systems engineers rely on accurate mathematical models in order
to properly understand how a system behaves, and to design optimal 
feedback mechanisms.
Mathematical models of systems are most often represented by differential equations.
Thus, the analysis of control algorithms is frequently identical to the analysis
of differential equations.

There are two modeling and analysis approaches in use for linear systems: 
frequency-domain approach, and state-space approach. 
Both of these methods are based on concepts taught in an Ordinary Differential 
Equations class.
This section will primarily focus on creating models of systems using the 
state-space approach.

## What makes up a differential equation
A differential equation is an equation consisting of function $y(t)$ and its
derivatives. 
$$
y^{(n)}(t) = f\left(t, y(t), y'(t), \cdots, y^{(n-1)}(t)\right).
$$
In mechanical systems, these functions often correspond to position ($x$), 
velocity ($v$) and acceleration ($a$), where
$$
v(t) = \frac{d}{dt}x(t) \text{ \quad and \quad } a(t) = \frac{d}{dt}v(t).
$$
However, this may not be the case. 
In more complicated systems, a model may consist of a system of differential
equations. 
If the model consists of two functions, $y_1, y_2$, then it will take the form:
$$
y_1^{(n)}(t) = f\left(
    t, 
    y_1(t), y_1'(t), \cdots, y_1^{(n-1)}(t), 
    y_2(t), y_2'(t), \cdots, y_2^{(n-1)}(t)
\right),
$$
$$
y_2^{(n)}(t) = g\left(
    t, 
    y_1(t), y_1'(t), \cdots, y_1^{(n-1)}(t), 
    y_2(t), y_2'(t), \cdots, y_2^{(n-1)}(t)
\right).
$$
The functions $y_1, y_1', \dots, y_1^{(n-1)}, y_2, y_2', \dots, y_2^{(n-1)}$
are called the *state* of the system. 
This is because knowing the values of these at a specific time 
allow you predict the future behavior of the system (assuming you know the dynamics).
You may notice that $y_1^{(n)}, y_2^{(n)}$ are considered state variables. 
This is because the 

As you may notice, these are pretty general, and unfortunately, mathematicians
have yet to determine general solutions for any of these.
Thus, for our purposes, we will instead look at a simpler form of model,
the Linear-Time-Invarient (LTI) System.
