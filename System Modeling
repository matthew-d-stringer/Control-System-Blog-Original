# Chapter 2: State-Space Representation of Dynamic Systems

## 2.1 Mathematical Models

Mathematical Models are fundamental to the design of feedback control systems.
Controls systems engineers rely on accurate mathematical models in order
to properly understand how a system behaves, and in order to design optimal 
feedback mechanisms.
Mathematical models of systems are most often represented by differential equations.
Thus, the analysis of control algorithms is often identical to the analysis
of differential equations.

There are two modeling and analysis approaches in use for linear systems: 
frequency-domain approach, and state-space approach. 
Both of these methods rely on techniques taught in an Ordinary Differential 
Equations class.
This chapter will primarly focus on creating state-space models of systems, 
while chapter 4 will focus on the frequency-domain approach.

The state-space representation of dyamical systems relies on representing creating
models that are systems of first-order differential equations.
