# Learning Control Theory from *Control System Design: An Introduction to State-Space Methods*

## What is this and who am I?
Control theory is a fascinating topic that applies some of the most interesting
mathematical concepts in real life applications!
In high school, I began learning about control theory through my experience on a 
local robotics team and I have been captivated ever since.
This series is designed for students who have taken Calculus, AP Physics 1, and
Linear Algebra.
This series will map my journey through Bernard Friedland's 
*Control System Design: An Introduction to State-Space Methods*.
Below are links to each of the sections involved:

1. [Introduction to System Modeling using Differential Equations](./System%20Modeling.html)
1. [Discussion of Differential Equations and their analysis]()
1. [Basics of Frequency-Domain Methods and Analysis]()
1. [Controlability and Observability]()
